# Layouts 

Lichtblick layouts enable users to design and save customized workspaces tailored to specific tasks or workflows. These layouts can be reused for recurring projects or shared with team members working on similar challenges.

## Use Cases for Layouts

Layouts are highly versatile and can be adapted to various engineering and development scenarios. For instance:

- **Perception Engineers**: Create layouts for sensor calibration tasks.
- **Planning Engineers**: Design layouts to visualize and analyze routing algorithm outputs.
- **Controls Engineers**: Configure layouts to monitor and debug robot kinematics.

The **Layouts** menu provides all the tools needed to create, modify, and share layouts, ensuring a streamlined workflow.
